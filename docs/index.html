  <h1>Welcome to the USN-TNM MathPhys Seminar Webpage!</h1>

  
  <p>This is a new seminar series under the Faculty of Technology, Natural Sciences and Maritime Sciences at the University of South-Eastern Norway, that is USN – TNM. The idea is to give blackboard (whiteboard) lectures in three of the campuses at USN: Kongsberg,
 Porsgrunn, Bakkenteigen (Vestfold). The date and speaker for seminar nr. n+1 will be decided at seminar nr. n. The time will always be Wednesdays 14.15 – 16 and the lectures should be scientific in mathematics, physics, or mathematical physics.</p>

      Seminar by Anna Pachol on <b>When Geometry Goes Quantum: a bird’s-eye view through algebraic structures 
(in applications to theoretical physics)</b>
    </ul>
Abstract: 
I will give a broad overview of algebraic structures that appear in fundamental questions of theoretical physics (such as quantum gravity), focusing in particular on ideas from noncommutative geometry and quantum groups (Hopf algebras). 
Noncommutative geometry, as a mathematical framework, naturally incorporates quantum structures (such as noncommuting observables as in quantum theory) into the description of spaces (or space-time). This offers a way to extend the language of general relativity, which is inherently formulated in terms of Riemannian geometry, toward settings where quantum and geometric aspects intertwine. 
In this framework quantum groups can play the role of quantum relativistic symmetries.
