  <h1>Welcome to the USN-TNM MathPhys Seminar Webpage!</h1>

  
  <p>This is a new seminar series under the Faculty of Technology, Natural Sciences and Maritime Sciences at the University of South-Eastern Norway, that is USN – TNM. The idea is to give blackboard (whiteboard) lectures in three of the campuses at USN: Kongsberg,
 Porsgrunn, Bakkenteigen (Vestfold). The date and speaker for seminar nr. n+1 will be decided at seminar nr. n. The time will always be Wednesdays 14.15 – 16 and the lectures should be scientific in mathematics, physics, or mathematical physics.
  This seminar can be viewed online, to obtain the link to join the seminars, please contact one of the organizers.

<p><b>Algebraic Quantum Reference Frames</b></p>
</ul>
Abstract: In recent years the concept of a 'Quantum Reference Frame' has been investigated from a number of different perspectives. A key idea is that of a 'relative observable', for example the position of one quantum particle relative to another. In order to include aspects of Quantum Field Theory in the theory, it is necessary to work with algebras and observables, rather than Hilbert spaces and states as in standard Quantum Mechanics.

I will describe an algebraic approach to QRFs, in which quantum systems are algebras equipped with an action of a symmetry group G, and reference frames are systems equipped with the further data of a map from the algebra of functions on a homogeneous space G/H. There are natural notions of 'relativisation' and 'localisation' of observables, and many links to other topics in operator algebras and representation theory, such as integrable actions, dynamical systems, induced representations, and coamenability.

I will not assume any knowledge of quantum reference frames, operator algebras, or unitary representation theory. This is work in progress, joint with Leon Loveridge at USN.
