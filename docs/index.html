  <h1>Welcome to the USN-TNM MathPhys Seminar Webpage!</h1>

  
  <p>This is a new seminar series under the Faculty of Technology, Natural Sciences and Maritime Sciences at the University of South-Eastern Norway, that is USN – TNM. The idea is to give blackboard (whiteboard) lectures in three of the campuses at USN: Kongsberg,
 Porsgrunn, Bakkenteigen (Vestfold). The date and speaker for seminar nr. n+1 will be decided at seminar nr. n. The time will always be Wednesdays 14.15 – 16 and the lectures should be scientific in mathematics, physics, or mathematical physics.</p>

       <ul>
      <li><b>Wednesday 29.10.2025 at 14:15</b>, Campus Kongsberg</li>
      Seminar by Leon D. Loveridge on <b>Von Neumann algebras and the observable structure of quantum field theories</b>
    </ul>
    Abstract: 
This will be a talk in 5 pieces, two of which relate to recent work. I'll start by introducing von Neumann algebras and their classification into three types. Then I'll talk about Tomita-Takesaki theory, modular automorphisms and connections to quantum statistical mechanics. After that, I'll discuss crossed products of von Neumann algebras by locally compact groups and by modular automorphisms, which may result in a von Neumann algebra of a different type. I'll then move on to quantum reference frames, and conclude with some remarks about further type change arising from an unsharpness in a time observable, mentioning briefly also the role of thermodynamics. Some of this may have something to do with computing entropies of (quantum) black holes and cosmological horizons.
