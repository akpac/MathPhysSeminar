      <li>Seminar by Leon D. Loveridge on "Von Neumann algebras and the observable structure of quantum field theories".</li>
    </ul>
    Abstract: 
This will be a talk in 5 pieces, two of which relate to recent work. I'll start by introducing von Neumann algebras and their classification into three types. Then I'll talk about Tomita-Takesaki theory, modular automorphisms and connections to quantum statistical mechanics. After that, I'll discuss crossed products of von Neumann algebras by locally compact groups and by modular automorphisms, which may result in a von Neumann algebra of a different type. I'll then move on to quantum reference frames, and conclude with some remarks about further type change arising from an unsharpness in a time observable, mentioning briefly also the role of thermodynamics. Some of this may have something to do with computing entropies of (quantum) black holes and cosmological horizons.

    <li>Seminar by Karina Bakkeløkken Hjelmervik on Impulsive Impact on Two- and Three-Dimensional Fluid Bodies</li>
    </ul>  
Abstract: This study investigates the behaviour of fluid bodies subjected to impulsive impact against a rigid plane wall. Analytical solutions are derived for various fluid geometries in both two and three dimensions, focusing on the immediate post-impact dynamics. The mathematical framework employs Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series representations to describe the velocity fields resulting from the impact.

    <li>Seminar by  Arvid Siqveland on Associative local function rings</li>
    </ul>  
    Abstract: In constructing algebraic moduli varieties, the concept of localization is important. By defining moduli varieties by deformation theory, we observe that the defined local function rings are close to the usual localization in the commutative case, and so can be used to define local function rings in the noncommutative situation. These rings are not necessarily local, so we will not call them localizations, rather fraction rings of division-closed subsets. We will start by defining simple modules over associative rings.
