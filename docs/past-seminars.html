       <p><b>When Geometry Goes Quantum: a bird’s-eye view through algebraic structures 
(in applications to theoretical physics)</b></p>
    </ul>
Abstract: 
I will give a broad overview of algebraic structures that appear in fundamental questions of theoretical physics (such as quantum gravity), focusing in particular on ideas from noncommutative geometry and quantum groups (Hopf algebras). 
Noncommutative geometry, as a mathematical framework, naturally incorporates quantum structures (such as noncommuting observables as in quantum theory) into the description of spaces (or space-time). This offers a way to extend the language of general relativity, which is inherently formulated in terms of Riemannian geometry, toward settings where quantum and geometric aspects intertwine. 
In this framework quantum groups can play the role of quantum relativistic symmetries.

      <b>Von Neumann algebras and the observable structure of quantum field theories</b>
    </ul>
    Abstract: 
This will be a talk in 5 pieces, two of which relate to recent work. I'll start by introducing von Neumann algebras and their classification into three types. Then I'll talk about Tomita-Takesaki theory, modular automorphisms and connections to quantum statistical mechanics. After that, I'll discuss crossed products of von Neumann algebras by locally compact groups and by modular automorphisms, which may result in a von Neumann algebra of a different type. I'll then move on to quantum reference frames, and conclude with some remarks about further type change arising from an unsharpness in a time observable, mentioning briefly also the role of thermodynamics. Some of this may have something to do with computing entropies of (quantum) black holes and cosmological horizons.

    <b>Impulsive Impact on Two- and Three-Dimensional Fluid Bodies</b>
    </ul>  
Abstract: This study investigates the behaviour of fluid bodies subjected to impulsive impact against a rigid plane wall. Analytical solutions are derived for various fluid geometries in both two and three dimensions, focusing on the immediate post-impact dynamics. The mathematical framework employs Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series representations to describe the velocity fields resulting from the impact.

    <b>Associative local function rings</b>
    </ul>  
    Abstract: In constructing algebraic moduli varieties, the concept of localization is important. By defining moduli varieties by deformation theory, we observe that the defined local function rings are close to the usual localization in the commutative case, and so can be used to define local function rings in the noncommutative situation. These rings are not necessarily local, so we will not call them localizations, rather fraction rings of division-closed subsets. We will start by defining simple modules over associative rings.
