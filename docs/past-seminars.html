<p><b>Recent progress in the resource theory of asymmetry and its applications</b></p>
</ul>
Abstract: Symmetry and symmetry breaking are among the central themes in physics and have attracted the interest of many physicists. Recently, the resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) [1-4], which approaches these issues from the perspective of resource theories, has been actively studied.
In the past few years, several foundational advances have been made in this framework. In particular, the iid-complete monotone that plays a role analogous to entanglement entropy has been identified for arbitrary compact Lie groups [2] as well as for arbitrary finite groups [3]. The resolution for compact Lie groups includes, as a corollary, a solution to the Marvian–Spekkens conjecture [4].
Building on this theoretical foundation, several developments related to the Wigner–Araki–Yanase (WAY) theorem [5-10] have also been obtained. These include extensions of the WAY theorem to the implementation of arbitrary unitary gates [11], and a unification of the WAY-type theorems, i.e. the WAY theorem, the Eastin–Knill theorem (a fundamental limitation on error correction under symmetry) [12], and the above unitary-gate results. The unification is formulated a universal trade-off inequality relating symmetry, irreversibility, and quantumness for arbitrary quantum dynamics [13]. Using this tradeoff relation, the WAY-type limitations can now be applied, for example, to quantum thermodynamics[14] and black hole evaporation [13] etc.
If time permits, I will also briefly touch upon some other recent developments, such as extensions of the above tradeoff and the WAY theorem to general resource theory beyond symmetry [15].

<p><b>Algebraic Quantum Reference Frames</b></p>
</ul>
Abstract: In recent years the concept of a 'Quantum Reference Frame' has been investigated from a number of different perspectives. A key idea is that of a 'relative observable', for example the position of one quantum particle relative to another. In order to include aspects of Quantum Field Theory in the theory, it is necessary to work with algebras and observables, rather than Hilbert spaces and states as in standard Quantum Mechanics.
I will describe an algebraic approach to QRFs, in which quantum systems are algebras equipped with an action of a symmetry group G, and reference frames are systems equipped with the further data of a map from the algebra of functions on a homogeneous space G/H. There are natural notions of 'relativisation' and 'localisation' of observables, and many links to other topics in operator algebras and representation theory, such as integrable actions, dynamical systems, induced representations, and coamenability.
I will not assume any knowledge of quantum reference frames, operator algebras, or unitary representation theory. This is work in progress, joint with Leon Loveridge at USN.

       <p><b>When Geometry Goes Quantum: a bird’s-eye view through algebraic structures 
(in applications to theoretical physics)</b></p>
    </ul>
Abstract: 
I will give a broad overview of algebraic structures that appear in fundamental questions of theoretical physics (such as quantum gravity), focusing in particular on ideas from noncommutative geometry and quantum groups (Hopf algebras). 
Noncommutative geometry, as a mathematical framework, naturally incorporates quantum structures (such as noncommuting observables as in quantum theory) into the description of spaces (or space-time). This offers a way to extend the language of general relativity, which is inherently formulated in terms of Riemannian geometry, toward settings where quantum and geometric aspects intertwine. 
In this framework quantum groups can play the role of quantum relativistic symmetries.

      <b>Von Neumann algebras and the observable structure of quantum field theories</b>
    </ul>
    Abstract: 
This will be a talk in 5 pieces, two of which relate to recent work. I'll start by introducing von Neumann algebras and their classification into three types. Then I'll talk about Tomita-Takesaki theory, modular automorphisms and connections to quantum statistical mechanics. After that, I'll discuss crossed products of von Neumann algebras by locally compact groups and by modular automorphisms, which may result in a von Neumann algebra of a different type. I'll then move on to quantum reference frames, and conclude with some remarks about further type change arising from an unsharpness in a time observable, mentioning briefly also the role of thermodynamics. Some of this may have something to do with computing entropies of (quantum) black holes and cosmological horizons.

    <b>Impulsive Impact on Two- and Three-Dimensional Fluid Bodies</b>
    </ul>  
Abstract: This study investigates the behaviour of fluid bodies subjected to impulsive impact against a rigid plane wall. Analytical solutions are derived for various fluid geometries in both two and three dimensions, focusing on the immediate post-impact dynamics. The mathematical framework employs Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series representations to describe the velocity fields resulting from the impact.

    <b>Associative local function rings</b>
    </ul>  
    Abstract: In constructing algebraic moduli varieties, the concept of localization is important. By defining moduli varieties by deformation theory, we observe that the defined local function rings are close to the usual localization in the commutative case, and so can be used to define local function rings in the noncommutative situation. These rings are not necessarily local, so we will not call them localizations, rather fraction rings of division-closed subsets. We will start by defining simple modules over associative rings.
